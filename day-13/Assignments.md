**Assignment 1:** Write a PL/pgSQL block that takes a category ID as an input parameter and uses an if-else statement to determine the average price of products in that category. If the average price is greater than $50, the block should output a message to the console indicating that the products in the category are expensive. If the average price is between $20 and $50, the block should output a message indicating that the products in the category are reasonably priced. If the average price is less than $20, the block should output a message indicating that the products in the category are inexpensive.

**Assignment 2:** Write a PL/pgSQL block that takes a supplier ID as an input parameter and uses an if-else statement to determine the total revenue generated by products supplied by that supplier in the previous year. If the revenue is greater than $1 million, the block should output a message to the console indicating that the supplier is a major contributor to revenue. If the revenue is between $500,000 and $1 million, the block should output a message indicating that the supplier is a significant contributor to revenue. If the revenue is less than $500,000, the block should output a message indicating that the supplier is a minor contributor to revenue.
